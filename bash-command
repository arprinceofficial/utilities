           -----------------------
1. Ensure your SSH key is added to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/arprince.pub

2. Confirm your ~/.ssh/config file
nano ~/.ssh/config

Add this
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/arprince (your ssh name)

3. Check the SSH agent
  eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

4. Verify SSH connection to GitHub
ssh -T git@github.com

5. !!! If git clone has show permission denied !!!

i) Set proper permissions for the SSH config file:
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
This sets the file permissions so that only the file's owner can read and write to it, which is required by SSH.
